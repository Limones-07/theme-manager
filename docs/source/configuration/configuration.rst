Configuration
=============

For `theme-manager` to work properly, it needs to be able to verify if its themes are properly installed
and enable them. For that, it uses each themes' configuration files to specify how these two things should
be done. It also needs to know how to modify some application-specific configuration files to set up things
like font styles and color schemes. 

The following sections will teach you where to put these files and how to write them.
