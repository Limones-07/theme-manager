Configuring applications
========================

To configure an application, you need a `TOML` or a `JSON` file. The recommended file type to configure manually
is `TOML` because of its simplicity, but there is no other difference between the two aside from the syntax.
Leave the `JSON` files for automatically generated configuration.
